## Bike Buyers Dashboard Project

### Overview

This project involves the creation of a data analysis dashboard in Google Sheets to explore and visualize insights into the behavior and preferences of bike buyers. The dataset used for analysis contains details of 1000 users with various attributes such as marital status, gender, income, and whether or not they purchased a bike.

### Project Steps

#### Step 1: Data Acquisition
Download the dataset provided or use a relevant dataset related to bike buyers, ensuring it includes customer demographics and purchase history.

#### Step 2: Google Sheets Set-up
Import the dataset into a new Google Sheets document, and familiarize yourself with basic functionalities like sorting, filtering, and basic formulas.

#### Step 3: Data Exploration
Explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents. Identify key variables that provide insights into bike buyersâ€™ behavior and preferences.

#### Step 4: Dashboard Design
Plan the layout of the dashboard, deciding on key metrics and visualizations. Create sections for demographics, purchasing trends, and relevant categories.

#### Step 5: Data Analysis and Visualization
Utilize Google Sheets features to perform data analysis, create pivot tables, charts, and graphs. Visualize key metrics like customer age distribution, popular bike models, and purchasing patterns.

#### Step 6: Interactive Elements
Enhance the dashboard with interactive elements such as dropdown menus or filters, allowing users to dynamically explore the data.

#### Step 7: Insights and Recommendations
Draw insights from the analysis and use them to make informed recommendations. For example, identify popular bikes among specific age groups or demographics.

#### Step 8: Documentation
Document the steps taken to create the dashboard, explaining design choices and any challenges faced. Summarize the insights gained and recommendations made.
